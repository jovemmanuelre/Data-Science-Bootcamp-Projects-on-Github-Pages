## Welcome my Github Pages!

I am Jov. Here I present all the projects and business cases that I worked on the Data Science bootcamp courses I took. 
I used my knowledge in Regression, Classification, Clustering, Basic Dendograms, Neural Networks, and Deep Learning to work on these projects.

# REGRESSION

## Project 1: Simple Linear Regression
I created a simple regression model for a sample real estate dataset using Pandas, Numpy, Statsmodels, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries in Python to understand and describe the causal relationship between Price and Size of the real estate properties.
I discovered that..

## Project 2: Multiple Linear Regression with Dummies
Using the same sample real estate dataset above, I created a multiple regression model using Pandas, Numpy, Statsmodels, Matplotlib, and Seaborn in Python to understand the causal relationship among Price, Size, and the availability of Sea View at the real estate properties. Here, Sea View is categorical variable, so I transformed it into a Dummy Variable to create my Model.
I discovered that..

## Project 3: Simple Linear Regression with sklearn
Instead of Statsmodels, here I used sklearn, with Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, to create a Simple Linear Regression model in Python and predict the price given the size of the real estate property.
My prediction has x accuracy rate.

## Project 4: Linear Regression using Real Life Example
Whaat is this Real Life Example? What did I create? What did I discover/predict? What is the outcome?

# CLUSTERING

## Project 5: Clustering the Countries
I did Clustering in Python using Matplotlib to plot the location of all countries in a graph. Using their respective latitudes and longitudes, I clustered the countries into 7. The graph shows the location of the countries per continent.

## Project 6: Clustering the Countries with Categorical Data
I clustered the countries into 7 categories based on their continents. The names of the continents are categorical data, so I mapped them into numerical data to show their clusters on a graph.
What made this different from the first, and what did I discover?

## Project 7: Market Segmentation with Clustering

# CLASSIFICATION

## Project 8: Simple and Multivariate Classification
