## Welcome my Github Pages!

I am Jov. Here I present all the projects and business cases that I worked on the Data Science bootcamp courses I took. 
I used my knowledge in Regression, Classification, Clustering, Basic Dendograms, Neural Networks, and Deep Learning to work on these projects.

# REGRESSION

## Project 1: Simple Linear Regression
I created a simple regression model for a sample real estate dataset using Pandas, Numpy, Statsmodels, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries in Python to understand and describe the causal relationship between Price and Size of the real estate properties.

## Project 2: Multiple Linear Regression with Dummies
Using the same sample real estate dataset above, I created a multiple regression model using Pandas, Numpy, Statsmodels, Matplotlib, and Seaborn in Python to understand the causal relationship among Price, Size, and the availability of Sea View at the real estate properties. Here, Sea View is categorical variable, so I transformed it into a Dummy Variable to create my Model.
