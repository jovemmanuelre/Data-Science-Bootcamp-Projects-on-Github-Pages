## Welcome my Github Pages!

I am Jov. Here I present all the projects and business cases that I worked on the Data Science bootcamp courses I took. 
I used my knowledge in Regression, Classification, Clustering, Basic Dendograms, Neural Networks, and Deep Learning to work on these projects.

#REGRESSION

Project 1: Simple Linear Regression
I created a simple regression model for a sample real estate dataset using Pandas, Numpy, Statsmodels, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries in Python to understand and describe the causal relationship between Price and Size of the real estate properties.
